# DXC Code Assessment (Encoder)
Instructions for using this program:
1. Run the main function
2. Provide your input in the following format:
   * To encode: 'ENCODE [plaintext]'
   * To decode: 'ENCODE [plaintext]'
   * To terminate the program: 'END'

This program runs until the user provides the 'END' command. The input is not case-sensitive but all encoded/decoded strings are returned in uppercase to adhere more closely to the assessment instructions. If the given input does not follow the correct format, the user will be prompted to try again with the right format.
